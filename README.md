This app is used with a Thingsee Device: https://thingsee.com/
<p>
This application is used for storing wine and delivering wine.
We use Thingsee to monitor the temperature, pressure and humidity in the wine cellar to keep the environment being the most suitable for wine.
We also use the position service to check the path when the staffs deliver wine to shops.
<p>
We also use the app to monitoring our own room environment, checking the ideal humidity level for the room, as well as the correct light level depend on working condition (play game, study or office work).
<p>
For the app to work, you need to set up your own Thingsee device, and allow it to measure Location (for map), Humidity, Temperature, Luminance (Light).
The app was tested location sensor interval at 10 second, and other measurement at 15 minutes.
